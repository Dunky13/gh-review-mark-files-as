# GitHub Pull Request Mark All Files as [Install here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cdodhippkioagjgbchpljiboecdljklm/)

Extension that adds 2 buttons to mark all files as viewed, or unchecks it. 
Especially useful on large PRs with many files, and you want to quickly (un)check all files.

Some non-descript change
